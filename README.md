# ðŸ§  AI Assistant â€“ Guide to Using Tools vs Functions

This guide explains when and how to use tools (functions exposed to the LLM) and when to rely on internal function calls in an AI-powered chat application.

## ðŸ”¹ When Is It Better to Create a Separate Tool?

- If the model needs to handle specific, isolated tasks (e.g., "Book a ticket", "Get city info"), defining a tool is the best approach.
- Tools give the model explicit permission to perform certain actions.
- Tools make it easier to monitor, log, test, and debug key operations.
- Clearly defined in the system message, tools act like API endpoints the model can call.
- Especially useful when the user asks things like: *"Can you reserve a table?"*

## ðŸ”¹ When to Use Functions After a Tool Call?

- After a tool completes a task, you may want to add supportive behavior like playing audio or showing an image â€” these are best handled by internal functions.
- Such functions donâ€™t need to be tools because theyâ€™re not directly part of the LLMâ€™s decision-making.
- You can also run automatic functions after each model reply (e.g., text-to-speech) regardless of whether a tool was called.
- This keeps the experience dynamic but doesnâ€™t overload the modelâ€™s reasoning.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools for Everything vs Supportive Functions?

- If the task is part of the core logic (e.g., booking, calculating prices), **define a Tool**.
- If the task supports the main response (e.g., speech or image generation), **use a function**.
- Combine both for rich interactions: tool for logic, function for presentation.
- For consistent actions (e.g., speaking every reply), functions are ideal.

## ðŸ”¹ Recommended Strategy for Your Project

- Define all core operations as **tools** (e.g., reservations, ticket prices).
- After tool execution, call any **additional media-related functions**.
- Use a **hybrid structure**: tools for logic, functions for enhancements.
- This ensures clarity, modular design, and a smooth user experience.
- Use internal functions for consistent behaviors that don't require model reasoning.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary Table

| Scenario | Recommended Method |
|----------|--------------------|
| Performing core task | Tool |
| Enhancing response with media | Function |
| Always play voice output | Function |
| User gives explicit command | Tool |
| Need to log/track operations | Tool |
| Auto-generate image or TTS | Function |
